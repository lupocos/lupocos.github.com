<p>Office scanners are made to copy office papers, not books. It is hard to fit correctly a book page and you also risk damaging the book.</p>

<p>There are commercial solutions today that simplify the process of digitalising books while lowering the chances of damage. Most of these make use of digital cameras, combined with some kind of software that converts the photos into readable documents. However, these solutions don&#8217;t work for all cameras and their prices put them beyond the reach of the average consumer.</p>

<p>Homer is a prototype that aims to bridge this gap. It works with simple digital cameras and uses a combination of free and open source software to transform loose digital images into a readable, searchable <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format' title='Portable Document Format (from Wikipedia'>PDF</a>. Plus, the software package includes an installer that automatically sets up all the programs, allowing also users with basic computer skills to benefit from the solution.</p>

<p>Our aim in putting together this prototype is to enable libraries, schools and individuals with limited budgets to have access to a simple and yet efficient book scanning solution.</p>

<h2 id='why_homer_'>Why <em>Homer</em> ?</h2>

<p>Homer is arguably an invented historical character credited with the authorship of the Iliad and the Odyssey, epic poems that are the beginning of the Western canon of literature.</p>

<p>If Homer indeed existed, it is possible that he belonged to a professional class of ancient sing-poets called <em>aoidoi</em> in classical Greece. The <em>aoidoi</em> used a generations-old technique that emerged from oral literary tradition to memorize and spread culture.</p>

<p>For the younger generations, Homer may also be the patriarch of the Simpsons family, an invention of modern-time <em>aoidoi</em> Matt Groening. This reference may suggest that Homer is a friendly book scanner, even to someone generally seen as incompetent and lazy as Mr. Simpson!</p>
