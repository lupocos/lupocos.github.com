The "prototype" is based on a [previous model][1] developed by [Daniel Reetz][3] and [Matti Kariluoma][4]. Dan is also the founder of an online community of hackers sharing their knowledge and passion for [do-it-yourself book scanning][2], which is where we drew most of our original inspiration.

On this wiki you will find information on how to use Homer, as well as how to contribute to it.
